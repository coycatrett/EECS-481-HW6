# EECS-481-HW6
In this repository, you can find project proposals and bug fix reports for how myself (Coy Catrett) and a partner contributed to the open source [SymPy project](https://github.com/sympy/sympy).

In the [project proposal](https://github.com/coycatrett/EECS-481-HW6/blob/main/Project%20Proposal.pdf), we identified several tasks/bug fixes to work focus on and gave a proposal on how to fix each task.
Eventually, we chose two bugs to work on, and [one of them](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/26540) was pulled into the SymPy project!
A more detailed analysis of our methods and results can be found in the [Bug Fix Report](https://github.com/coycatrett/EECS-481-HW6/blob/main/Bug%20Fix%20Report.pdf).
